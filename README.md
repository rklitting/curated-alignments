## Curated alignments
 
We periodically combine genomic sequences generated as part of our consortium with publicly available sequences. 

Sequences with lower quality (manual curation, 8 removed) and incomplete sequences (<95% of (GP+NP) or (Z+L) ORFs length, 289 removed) are excluded from the curated alignment. Remaining sequences are trimmed to their coding regions, codon aligned using [mafft](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/tips0.html) and inspected manually. ORFs are arranged in sense orientation as follows:

S segment: NP -NNNNNN- GP

L segment: L -NNNNNN- Z

To control for alignment accuracy, a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny is reconstructed with RAxML using the general time-reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model, gamma-distributed rates among sites and bootstrap resampling with 500 replicates.

We will be releasing such curated alignments periodically to be used by the broader community for downstream analyses.
